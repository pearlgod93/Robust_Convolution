# Robust_Convolution
Convolution operation on signal - Using Loop-rollover method

Using loop-rollover performs convolution of signals

The file named 'waveforms.cpp' is a sinusoidal signal with noise, and the impulse response signal is a low-pass filter which removes the high frequency components in the signal. 

Built using C++, coded in Codeblocks Enviroment.
